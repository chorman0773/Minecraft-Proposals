<h1>Proposal for Custom Enchantments</h1>

With the introduction of Datapacks, Map-makers and server operators gained a powerful tool to change the user experience without adding modifications. 
However, even with this, many features still require modifications to implement, and many are non-trivial. Implementing Custom Enchantments is especially difficult (I have experience with this, having written a custom enchantment system). This proposal enables server operators and map-makers to add custom enchantments in vanilla. 

The proposed syntax is defined in [CustomEnchantments.md](https://github.com/chorman0773/Minecraft-Proposals/blob/master/Custom%20Enchantments/CustomEnchantments.md). 

The proposal has 3 parts:
<ol type="1">
<li>Adding Enchantment Tags to datapacks and defining how these tags can be used</li>
<li>Adding additional vanilla item tags, to make creating custom enchantments easier</li>
<li>Defining the Concrete, Work In Progress, syntax and structure for creating custom enchantments</li>
</ol>
