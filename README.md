# Minecraft-Proposals
Various Proposals to Mojang for features to be added to minecraft in future versions. Here because BB Markup is really good.

Will release both high level descriptions of the various proposals, as well as the suggested patch files for that particular proposal. The patch files were generated via patch differences of various versions. The Minecraft Version and the MCP Version will both be documented in the patch.
